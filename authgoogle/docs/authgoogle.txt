This module provides an authentication source that points specifically at Google OpenId



`authgoogle:OpenIDConsumer`
: authentication source based on Google OpenID


`authgoogle:OpenIDConsumer`
---------------------------

Configuration:

    'authgoogle' => array(
        'authgoogle:OpenIDConsumer',
        'forcelogin' => true,  // optionally force login again
		'googleDomain' => 'ompka.net', // optionally specify a login domain
    ),

    
forcelogin - this requests Google to challenge the user with the login screen 
on each authentication request.


The three attributes you can get access to are email, firstname, and lastname.


Important:

Please note that this module does not restrict who can login from Google - to do this you will
need to implement further authproc rules - some possible configurations are:

        // grab the organisation from the email address
        50 => array(
            'class' => 'core:ScopeFromAttribute',
            'sourceAttribute' => 'email',
            'targetAttribute' => 'mlepOrganisation',
        ),

        // restrict access to a particular organisation scope
        85 => array('class' => 'authorize:Authorize',
                    'mlepOrganisation' => '/^hogwarts\.school\.nz$/',
                    ),

Note: these examples are specific to New Zealand K12 school requirements, but I hope you get the 
picture.
